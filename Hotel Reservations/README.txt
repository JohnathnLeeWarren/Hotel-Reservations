I was trying to build my frist big project and didnt know that I couldn't
combine 3 .cpp files togeather. 

The project was suppose to be a Hotel Reservation app.

-The EMPLOER FILE-
Holds all the basic info and Employer descions like Rooms: Smoking or non-Smoking, 
How many rooms are avaliable. Food & Beverages: The kinds of food and Beverages served,
qunity, prices, and last Sales: How much an Employer made in a day.

-The Login_Reg File-
Hold the login features like username and password. Plus the Registion.
Also a forgot password feature.  //I haven't figured it out yet still working//

-The User File-
Hold all the User options like Room Reservations, What kind of food and Beverages they
could order before they check-in. I was working on a check-out feature as well still
trying to think of the math.

This is my frist README file please dont be to harsh on lol, and forgive the grammer.
I also noticed once to upload to github from Vs Code then try to run your files 
again it goes straight into debug mode dont know why stiling learning everything.
